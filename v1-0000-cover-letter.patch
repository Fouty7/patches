Subject: [PATCH v1 0/1] Aminu Ndakun -- Assignment 0 submission

I believe after dealing with some few unexpected errors, my success rate
should be 100%

The materials were helpful, and my fellow mentees were always willing to
brainstorm

Also as updated in A0 output of "uname -a" is now appended to aminu_ndakun.md
